This is a tool that demonstrates a Neural Network attempting to solve a simple puzzle. It allows the user to test the effects of different data sets, number of neurons in the system, and patterns on the accuracy of the system.

# How To Use
The Network is attempting to predict the correct answer to a pattern it is given based off of 6 examples. The Answer to each pattern is simple, whatever digit is in the 1st position in the array is the correct answer. Each pattern only contains 1's and 0's, however each pattern in the data set is randomly generated, as is true with the pattern being processed. Thus each control allows you to play with the different properties of the system. (P.S. the answer will be between 1 and 0, the closer it is to either number is how sure it is of that number)

# Things to Try
- how does the variety of patterns effect the accuracy of the system? if 5 of the patterns have the answer of 0, is the system accurate when the answer is 1?
- does the number of neurons in the system help it become more or less accurate?
- if the system is off of its intended answer, why is that?
